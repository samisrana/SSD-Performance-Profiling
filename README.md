This project aims to provide hands-on experience in profiling the performance of modern SSDs, focusing on latency and throughput under different conditions. We use the Flexible IO Tester (FIO), a widely used tool for benchmarking storage devices, to evaluate the performance of your SSD with different access patterns, data sizes, read/write ratios, and queue depths.
